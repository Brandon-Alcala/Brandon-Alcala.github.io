	<p>Hello my name is Brandon and I am currently a Sophomore in High School. I enrolled in the Engineering Academy in 2015 as a Freshman.</p>
	<p> Some of my hobbies are to edit videos of any kind, draw, listen to music, watch t.v. and sometimes play Xbox with some of my friends.</p>
	<p> A couple of my favorite t.v. shows to watch are The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow. As you might tell I enjoy watching DC shows, and I wouldn't mind watching Marvel. The only problem is that there isn't that many Marvel shows. I am also a big fan of comics of any sort, as long as they have action or adventure.</p>
